Handle dual monitor setup with plank and switch seamlessly between single/dual monitor setup

All dock configuration (launchers, settings, etc...) should be done on primary dock (dock1) as any changes made to the secondary dock will be lost

Use xrandr to get the primary monitor ID and adapt the script accordingly (line 4)

Run the script from the command line or launch it along with any other startup scripts
